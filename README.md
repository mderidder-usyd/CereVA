# CereVA
CereVA is an uncertainty visual analytics framework for fMRI functional connectivity. The implementation here works largely as described in An uncertainty visual analytics framework for fMRI functional connectivity (under review). In the preparation and development for that paper, confidential, ethics-protected patient data was used. All traces of that data have been removed from the code here, however some of the smaller aspects and features described in the paper may be broken or missing. The two two examples provided are simulation data created to illustrate how the components fit together. To run the software, download all the files and place them into a web server. For quick testing, the http-server package within nodejs is recommended.
